# The Coca King and the Agricultural Revolution That Shaped Bolivia

José María Gamarra Gutierrez, father-in-law of Teresita, played a monumental role in developing the Los Yungas region of La Paz during the first half of the 20th century. His Industrial Agricultural Society became not just a business, but a transformative force that reshaped the economic and social landscape of an entire region.

## A Business Empire in the Andes: Bolivia's Agricultural Giant

Before the landmark agrarian reform of 1953, the Industrial Agricultural Society "José María Gamarra S.A" stood as **the most important agricultural company in Bolivia**. The company's holdings were vast and strategically positioned, owning 30 productive farms (haciendas) primarily concentrated in the Nor Yungas provinces, where the ideal climate and altitude created perfect conditions for coca cultivation.

This wasn't merely land ownership—it was systematic agricultural development on an unprecedented scale in Bolivian history. The Society employed thousands of workers, created entire communities, and established supply chains that connected the remote Yungas valleys to national and international markets.

### Infrastructure Legacy: Building the Foundation of Modern Yungas

The Gamarra Society's impact extended far beyond agriculture. Understanding that economic development required modern infrastructure, Don José María invested heavily in building the region's essential facilities:

#### Roads and Transportation Networks
Construction of critical transportation routes throughout the Yungas provinces transformed what had been isolated mountain communities into connected, commercially viable zones. These roads, many still in use today, opened access to markets and reduced travel time from days to hours.

#### Healthcare Infrastructure
The establishment of a hospital in Coripata represented a revolutionary commitment to worker welfare in an era when such corporate social responsibility was virtually unheard of. This medical facility served not only company employees but entire communities in the surrounding areas, providing healthcare where none had existed before.

#### Sports and Community Development
The construction of the José María Gamarra Stadium (later renamed "Ramiro Castillo Stadium" in honor of renowned Bolivian soccer player Ramiro Castillo, who was born in the region) demonstrated the Society's commitment to community well-being beyond basic economic needs. The stadium became a social hub where communities gathered, celebrating local culture and fostering regional pride.

### Agricultural Innovation: Transforming Bolivian Agriculture

The Society's most lasting legacy lies in the agricultural innovations it introduced to Bolivia. Don José María's vision extended beyond profit to genuine agricultural advancement:

#### The Guayaquil Banana Revolution
First-class quality bananas from Ecuador, known as "Plátano Guayaquil," were introduced to Bolivia for the first time through carefully planned importation of plantings from Ecuador. This wasn't simple transplantation—it required understanding soil conditions, climate variations, and cultivation techniques. The success of this program established banana cultivation as a major agricultural sector in the Yungas region, diversifying the economy and creating new export opportunities.

The introduction of Guayaquil bananas demonstrated sophisticated agricultural thinking: rather than relying solely on coca, the Society promoted crop diversification that would protect farmers from market fluctuations while enriching the region's agricultural portfolio.

#### Coffee Excellence and Quality Improvement
The Society made significant contributions to improving coffee cultivation methods and quality throughout the region. By introducing better processing techniques, quality control standards, and market connections, they elevated Bolivian coffee from a local commodity to a product capable of competing in international markets.

Coffee cultivation in Yungas had existed for decades, but the Gamarra Society's systematic approach to quality improvement—including the introduction of better varieties, proper fermentation processes, and standardized drying methods—revolutionized the industry.

#### The Coca King: Economic Power Through Quality

The Society's greatest impact came from producing exceptional quality coca leaves. As the **principal producer in what was essentially an oligopoly**, Don José María earned the title **"El Rey de la Coca"** (The Coca King). This wasn't an empty honorific—it reflected genuine market dominance built on consistent quality.

The coca produced by Gamarra's haciendas became the standard against which all other coca was measured. The leaves from Tiwanaku varieties cultivated in Yungas commanded premium prices because of their superior alkaloid content and processing quality. Traditional consumers—miners, farmers, and urban workers who used coca for its legitimate traditional purposes—specifically sought out Gamarra coca.

It's essential to understand the historical context: during this era (1900-1953), drug trafficking did not exist in the form we know today. Coca consumption was exclusively for traditional and medicinal purposes, deeply rooted in Andean culture going back millennia. The coca leaf was (and remains) legal in Bolivia, recognized as an integral part of indigenous heritage and daily life.

## Economic Cornerstone: Funding an Entire Department

The Society's economic impact extended beyond its direct operations. It became the **primary source of tax revenue** for the La Paz department budget, thanks to coca leaf taxation. This means the Society wasn't merely a private enterprise—it was a fundamental pillar of regional public finance.

Tax revenues from the Society helped fund:
- Public education in La Paz department
- Road maintenance and new construction
- Healthcare facilities in urban areas
- Administrative government operations
- Public safety and security services

Without the tax revenues generated by Gamarra's coca production, the La Paz departmental government would have struggled to provide even basic services. In effect, the Society's success enabled government functionality throughout the region.

## Historical Context: The World Before Agrarian Reform

This exhibition piece represents a pivotal chapter in Bolivian economic history, showcasing how agricultural innovation and entrepreneurship shaped the development of an entire region before the transformative agrarian reforms of the 1950s.

The 1953 agrarian reform fundamentally restructured Bolivian society, breaking up large haciendas and redistributing land to indigenous farmers and workers. While this reform was necessary and ultimately beneficial for social justice, it also marked the end of an era of large-scale agricultural enterprises like the Gamarra Society.

Today, the Gamarra Society serves as a historical case study in several areas:
- **Agricultural development**: How systematic investment and innovation can transform a region
- **Corporate social responsibility**: Early examples of companies investing in worker welfare
- **Economic concentration**: The benefits and risks of oligopolistic market structures
- **Cultural heritage**: The legitimate traditional use of coca before its association with illegal drug trade

### The Gamarra Legacy in Modern Bolivia

While the Industrial Agricultural Society no longer exists in its original form, its legacy remains visible throughout the Yungas region:
- Roads built by the Society still serve as main transportation routes
- The hospital in Coripata evolved into a regional medical center
- Agricultural techniques introduced by the Society continue to influence farming practices
- Families whose grandparents worked for the Society still farm land in the region

Don José María Gamarra's vision extended beyond his lifetime, creating infrastructure and systems that continued benefiting the region long after the agrarian reform ended the era of large haciendas.
