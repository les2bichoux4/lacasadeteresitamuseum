# Don José María Gamarra Gutierrez: The Coca King of Yungas

This striking oil painting by the renowned Chilean portraitist Ahumada captures the dignified presence of Don José María Gamarra Gutierrez, known throughout Bolivia as **"El Rey de la Coca"** (The Coca King).

## The Man Behind the Portrait

Don José María wasn't just a successful businessman—he was a visionary who transformed the agricultural landscape of the Yungas region. His title of "Coca King" was earned through decades of dedication to producing the finest quality coca leaves in Bolivia, while simultaneously developing infrastructure and improving the lives of countless families in the region.

## Artistic Significance

The portrait exemplifies the classical style of early 20th-century Latin American portraiture. Ahumada, a Chilean master of the genre, was known for capturing not just the physical likeness of his subjects, but their essence and social standing. The formal composition and careful attention to detail reflect the respect and prominence Don José María commanded in Bolivian society.

## A Legacy Preserved

This portrait has hung in the family home for generations, a constant reminder of the patriarch who built an empire while never forgetting his responsibility to his community. The painting serves as both a work of art and a historical document, preserving the memory of a man whose influence shaped an entire region.

## The Coca King's Impact

While this portrait shows us the man, the true measure of Don José María's legacy lies in:

- The 30 productive haciendas that employed thousands
- The roads, hospitals, and stadiums he built
- The agricultural innovations he introduced
- The generations of his family who continued his work in medicine and public service

This painting invites us to look into the eyes of a man who saw possibility where others saw only mountains and valleys, and who built a legacy that extended far beyond coca leaves.
